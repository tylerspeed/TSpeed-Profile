      ABOUT ME
    </h2>
    <article id="Technology">
      <!-- Discuss interest / experience in technology since I was a kiddo -->
    <p>I live in Oregon with my wife, Chrisse, and our two cats, Zipper and Elliot. We both work in technology, and we love hiking, biking, kayaking and spending time with one another on various
      outdoor adventures.
    </p>
      <p>I have been involved in technology since I was a kid, and used to build computers and write BASIC programs on our family's PC when I was a kid.  For a few years,
      I even helped manage a couple of Bulletin Board Services.  Over the years, my interest in technology and web development has grown.  In college,
      I earned my MS in Computer Science, with a focus on computer and information security.
    </p>

    <!-- Discuss why Thinkful? Attempt to formalize web dev education, etc...-->

    <p>I had tinkered all my life on the Internet, building websites for friends, and writing small database
      programs for inventory control and sales tracking in my day job.  Even with the steady exposure to programming and web app development, I always wanted to formalize my learning.
      Toward that end, I am currently enrolled as a Flex student in Thinkful's full stack engineering program.  My projected graduation date is September of 2021.
    </p>

    <p>
      <!-- Discuss current role, tie in with tech / project managment, etc...-->
      In my current role, I work with clients to solve technical issues. Mostly, my work is about finding the right hardware and software solutions for project stakeholders.
