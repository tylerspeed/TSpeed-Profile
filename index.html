    About Me
  </h2>
  <article id="Technology">
  <p>I have been involved in technology since I was a kid, and used to build computers.  I helped manage Bulletin Board Services before the Internet, and built early websites</p>
  <p>
    For nearly 20 years, I've worked with engineering teams to help manage and deliver custom hardware and software solutions.
