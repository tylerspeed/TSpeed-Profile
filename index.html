    ABOUT ME
  </h2>
  <article id="Technology">
  <p>I have been involved in technology since I was a kid, and used to build computers and write BASIC programs on our family's PC.  For a couple years, I even helped manage Bulletin Board Services before the Internet, and built early websites.Over the years, my interest has grown, and eventually I earned my MS in Computer Science.  I am currently enrolled as a Flex student in Thinkful's full stack engineering program.
  </p>

  <p>
    In my current role, I work with clients to solve technical issues. Mostly, my work is about finding the right hardware and software solutions for project stakeholders.
