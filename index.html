      <h2>INTRO</h2>
      <p>My name is Tyler Speed, and I am currently enrolled in an engineering program at Thinkful.  I live in Oregon with my wife, Chrisse, and our two cats, Zipper and Elliot. My wife and I both work in technology, and we love hiking, biking, kayaking and spending time with one another on various
      outdoor adventures.

      <!-- A little history about me-->
      ABOUT ME
    </h2>

      <!-- Discuss interest / experience in technology since I was a kiddo -->
    <p>I have tinkered all my life on the Internet, building websites for friends, and writing small database
      programs for inventory control and sales tracking in my day job. I particularly enjoy the duality of programming, in that it is both collaborative and autonomous.
    </p>
    <p>I used to build computers and write BASIC programs on our family's PC when I was a kid, and for a few years
      I even helped manage a couple of Bulletin Board Services. I eventually obtained my masters in Computer Science, but still felt I was lacking in then fundamentals of
      web development. This is why I decided to enroll as a Flex student in Thinkful's full stack engineering program.  My projected graduation date is September of 2021.
    </p>
    <p>Although technology is a passion of mine, I have dabbled in many different hobbies and interests. I love working with my hands, and have created small metal art sculptures, leather
      bags, and many other crafts.  I even took some classes in shoemaking years ago, and made myself a pair of men's Oxford shoes.
    </p>

    <!-- Discuss why Thinkful? Attempt to formalize web dev education, etc...-->



    <p>
      <!-- Discuss current role, tie in with tech / project managment, etc...-->
      In my current role, I work with clients to solve technical issues. Mostly, my work is about finding the right hardware and software solutions for project stakeholders.
